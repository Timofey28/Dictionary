!But_in_zero-gravity_conditions_it_is_possible to grow large crystals and to study their structure # !Convection_makes_the_production_of_some_materials very difficult on Earth # !Experts_estimate_that_within_a_few_coming_years the industrial production of various materials is to begin in space # !In_space_there_is_no_gravitational_convection i.e. movement of gases or liquids because of difference of temperatures # !It_should_be_said_that_research_and_preparatory_work for industrial production of new-generation materials at a larger scale is being carried out in Russia, the USA, Europe and Japan # !Numerous_experiments_on_board the Russian manned and unmanned space vehicles and space stations proved the advantages of the zero-gravity state for the production of some materials # !They_may_include super and semiconductors, metals, glasses, superpure biologically active substances, etc #
